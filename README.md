**Wordle**
=============
The purpose of this application is run the game Wordle, which is currently at the time of writing, owned by the NY times. The game, using this application, has been ported to java. Within this version of Wordle, you will have 6 chances to guess a random 5 letter word. However, this game will try to guide you toward to correct answer upon every of your incorrect answers. Anytime you answer a word, some letters within your word may be colored. The letters that aren't colored are not all within the word you are trying to guess. The words colored in cyan, however, are in the word you are trying to guess, however, the spot in which you placed the letter is incorrect. Lastly, any letter colored in green is in the word you are trying to guess and is in the correct spot. If you do not guess the word within 6 guesses though, the word you were trying to guess will be revealed.
